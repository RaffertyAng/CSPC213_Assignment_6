An assignment I completed in CPSC213(Introduction to Computer Systems) at UBC. 

The main assignment in folder 'q1-2_code' was to implement a reference counting system for class 'element' that keeps count the number of references to an 'element' object, 
and deallocates the memory occupied by the object once there are no references pointing to the object.
